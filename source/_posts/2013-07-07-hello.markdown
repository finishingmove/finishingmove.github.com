Not much, eh? Well, you tell that to our friend Neo...

As is the case with any newly acquired knowledge, programming can be a bit of a shock initially.
Fortunately, not each *red pill* has implications as severe as *The Matrix* portrays.
Pill-munching and metaphor-crunching aside, if you ever considered learning programming, just do it.
And don't stop at one programming language, learn as many as you can. It will open your mind to new ways of thinking
that, contrary to popular belief, are in fact useful in the "real world" -- and evermore so. Understanding machines is,
and will continue to be, an important mean for our own evolution.

In case you're still here, I'm pleased to inform you that this blog will *not* deal with (many) metaphysical issues.
Rather, it will be a journey into programming, exploring various languages and paradigms. There's a long way to go,
for both you and me. Hopefully, you will answer your own *whys* in time. To aid you in that, pills will be
handed out in different flavours:

- JavaScript
- Haskell
- Clojure
- Ruby
- PHP
- other?

The taste of some might be bitter at first, but it will grow on you after some time :)
